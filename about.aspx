							<h4>My history</h4>
							<p>The society established a group in 2016 in order to work on social welfare, skill development and women's empowerment, in which we circulated and circulated in our city, in which we found our society needed different skills, that one We have a big requirement and then we took a place that gave information about Parlr, Sewing, Kadhai and Computer.<br />
                                In this way we gave information about our skills. So far, we had provided the skills training to 200 without any social assistance.
After this, we decided to give technical class to the children for which we registered for the Prime Minister Skill Development Scheme and we helped 475 children and helped the smart class of skill development, whose result was 100 percent.<br />
                                After this we started our 1st branch in 2017, in which we gave a smart class to 360 children. In this smart class we have trained in skill development, entrepreneurship, computer knowledge, speaking English, personality development or field maintenance.
In which the skills of the children were cleansed and cleared.<br />
                                In 2018, we got separate courses for children with a fee of Rs 250 only, in which 15 days, 45 days, 96 days and 135 days of mass training were given.
<br />200 children in 15 days
